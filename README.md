# Thor's "Golf It" Internal
# a simple c++ internal movement hack for the steam game golf it

Allows you to fly your golfball around the map in both singleplayer and multiplayer settings.

Uses my memory wrapper asgard and and external library minhook to function

if want to build it yourself make sure you put MinHook.x64.dll and Asgard.dll in the same folder as the executable file.
Otherwise just download it from the release folder and use the dlls already included in there

Keybinds:
W,S (using camera for direction
LCTRL speed up
LSHIFT slow down
RSHIFT toggle
