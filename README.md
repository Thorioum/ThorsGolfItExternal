# Thor's "Golf It" Internal
# a simple c++ internal movement hack for the steam game golf it (now working again)

Uses my skid soup memory wrapper asgard and minhook to function
if you for some reason want to build it yourself make sure you put MinHook.x64.dll and Asgard.dll in the same folder as the exe
Otherwise just download it from the release folder and use the dlls already included in there

Keybinds:
W,S (using camera for direction
LCTRL speed up
LSHIFT slow down
RSHIFT toggle

Open the golf it process and launch the exe, it shouldnt crash in the main menu
It works in multiplayer to some extent, but its "random" which ball you control when you play
so just wait until your last standing for a 100% chance to control your own
